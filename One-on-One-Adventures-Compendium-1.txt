                                          Foreword
Welcome to the One on One Adventures Compendium, a collection of eleven adventures designed for 1 gamemaster
and 1 player- powered by the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game! What started as a novel idea for a product in 2004 has
matured into a full blown line five years later, serving a niche in the gaming community as people have less time
and opportunity to get the old gaming group together but still have the desire to roll the bones.
     A little history for those who are interested: One on One Adventures was the brainchild of a summer spent in
the Great Thar Desert and a winter spent in the Himalayas. Expeditious Retreat Press had just opened shop a year
earlier and we were working on larger books for the Magical Society Line. Craving projects of a smaller scope and
more open to creativity, we considered a line of adventures, but with the field fully saturated, we knew we needed
something that made our adventures stand out.
     It was at this time that we moved to India and if you think getting a gaming group together on nights and
weekends in the states is hard, try doing it off season in extreme environments on the subcontinent! And that was
the “Eureka!” moment. We couldn’t be the only ones in this situation; life circumstances and geography must be
preventing other gamers from getting a full-sized group together, so let’s make it easier for smaller groups to play.
     Traditional adventures generally have an assumed number of players, depending on the rules, and scaling
down adventures for fewer players becomes progressively more difficult. With that in mind, we decided to start
with the smallest gaming group of one, as adding more adversaries for parties of 2 or 3 seemed much less daunting
and time consuming.
     We had the line established with the first few titles in various stages of production, when the short film Fear of
Girls came out. The opportunity to produce The Pleasure Prison of the B’thuvian Demon Whore in One on One Adventures
was too tempting. Krunk the barbarian of the frozen waste, that god amongst men, was the perfect introduction of
the line concept, and the Todd Lockwood cover was the icing on the cake. And so One on One Adventures was born,
making a large splash publicly when 1 on 1 Adventures 6.66: The Pleasure Prison of the B’thuvian Demon Whore
took home a silver award for Best Adventure at the 2006 Gen Con EN World RPG Awards.
     While the idea for the line was a product of necessity, the fans have found so many more uses. We’ve had
people use our modules for tournaments in their regular gaming group, breaking down the party of 4 into 4 parties
of 1. We’ve had parents use our modules to introduce gaming to their children as a smaller group size offers fewer
distractions. We’ve had people use these modules to introduce the concept of tabletop roleplaying to non-gaming
significant others. We’ve had people use these modules as an introduction to gamemastering, since you only have
to put the smack down on 1 player.
     At the end of the day, we discovered that One on One Adventures is for a wide variety of gamers, even though
it started with a simple niche goal. This line is not only for the gamers who find getting at least 5 people together
more and more challenging. This line is for all gamers and we are so glad that fans have found fun and joy through
something we produced.

Good Gaming,

Something is amiss in the town of Rhiannon. Recently raided by a band of vile creatures, the citizens of Rhiannon were shocked
to find their lord at the root of the incident. And now Lord Kent is holding a competition for “all walks of life with a propensity
for the gambling arts.” Will the PC aid the citizens of Rhiannon and uncover the truth about the mysterious Lord Kent? Or will
                                         the PC take this opportunity to line her own pockets?

                   Either way, the answers lie inside the walls of Lord Kent’s keep and the gamblers within.

                                                        Scaling the Adventure
    Gambler’s Quest is designed to challenge a single character of 2nd-4th levels. However, you can easily run the adventure
    for characters of a higher level, and even for more than one character if you so desire, by making minor changes and
    preparations before play.
    For a Single Character of 5th-7th levels: To run Gambler’s Quest with characters of these levels, consider the following.
         • Advance each guest NPC 2-4 levels, save for Sariah Redshift, who should be of equal level (as she should prove to
              be a primary antagonist). Kara and Uther should be two levels lower than the PC.
         • Change Medifir Blacktooth into a werewolf instead of a wererat.
         • Advance each guard and creature in Area 9 and Area 14 (the gnoll and orc barracks, respectively) so that each
              room’s EL is 1-2 higher than currently listed. Make Grendel (the orc chieftain) and Fangrid (the gnoll sergeant)
              each two levels lower than the PC.
         • Advance Lord Kent to one level higher than the PC. However, maintain his spelllist’s focus on damaging and
              protective spells. Avoid spells with a “Save or Incapacitate” effect as for a single PC, they are tremendously
              dangerous and don’t make for a lot of fun for a single player.
         • In the dungeons, advance the skeletons and zombies 1-2 HD and replace the ghoul with a ghast, and depending on
              the character’s level, consider advancing the ghast’s Hit Dice. Consider replacing the medium monstrous spider
              with a large monstrous spider. Advance the ghost in Area 26 one level and allow it to materialize in a single
              round.
    For a Multiple characters: To run Gambler’s Quest with more than one character, consider the following changes.
         • Add an appropriate number of guest rooms to the castle for PCs, and one additional guest (a roommate) for each other
              guest room.
         • As a rule of thumb, add an extra guard or appropriate creature to each encounter for each additional PC.
         • Create a second servant (a counterpart for Kara) to help keep order at the tournament.
         • Make encountering Lord Kent CR 3 higher than the APL. Make encountering Uther CR 2 higher than the APL and
              give him an appropriate set of guards. Make Grendel (the orc chieftain) and Fangrid (the gnoll chieftain) each
              CR 1 higher than the APL, and give them each an appropriate set of guards.


                                                                      4

the other guests to determine who is a likely recruit and who
may need to be “dealt with.”
     The black tulip is actually a deep purple color and is
Sariah’s hallmark. She places such a tulip at scenes where she
commits unscrupulous acts (acts of thievery and murder, among
her other crimes), and the practice has made her somewhat
notorious (although her true identity is not widely known, her
deeds have astutely been attributed to “The Black Tulip”).

  Experience: The PC can earn a bit of extra experience by
  laying the ghost to rest once and for all. She can accomplish
  this task by sprinkling holy water on the skeletal remains.
  Should the character tell Brigit of the ghostly presence and ask
  for her help, she agrees to examine the chamber and remains,
  and creates a vial of holy water (by casting bless water) to set
  the ghost at rest. Award an extra CR 3 experience bonus to
  characters that do so.
       Treasure: The ritual dagger in the skeleton’s chest is
  masterwork.


  27. Dried Well (EL 1)
      An old well, the mouth being perhaps ten feet wide, is central
      to this chamber. It looks as if it has not been in use for many
      years, as the crumbling stone wall along its edge attests.

  Leaning against the well to look within its depths is an
  invitation to disaster. If a character states she wishes wish
  to look into the well, she must succeed at DC 10 Acrobatics
  checks (balance) or fall, as the stones around her crumble
  away. If the PC doesn’t fall, she can peer down the well and,
  with a DC 10 Perception check, notice that the well is filled
  wall to wall with thick webs. A DC 5 sound-based Perception
  check will notice that the well is empty (no splashes), and a DC
  25 Perception check will notice a slight breeze flowing down
  into the well, as if there was an opening below.
       Creatures: Luckily (or perhaps unluckily), a Medium
  monstrous spider has claimed the well for its home and has
  spun a web ten feet above the cavern floor (the well is a total
  of 30 feet deep), that falling characters automatically get caught
  in. A character can escape the web by succeeding at a DC 12
  Escape Artist check, or a DC 16 Strength check. Either way, the
  character falls 10 feet, and takes 1d6 points of damage. If you are
  feeling generous, you can allow the character a DC 15 Acrobatics         SPECIAL ABILITIES
  check (balance) to see if she can use the web to carefully drop          Poison (Ex): Bite—injury; save Fort

                  One on one Adventures #2
              the Star of Olindor
                            by Matthew J. HansoN
                   An adventure for one rogue levels 6-8




A terrible plague has swept through the city of Cairdus, and despite the local clergy’s best efforts, they have been unable
to control the spread of the disease. Even those who seem cured often contract the disease again. The only thing that is
making any headway are the special blessings given by the powerful Baron Velstaf, but he only grants these blessings for
                                                   a price that few can afford.
The Star of Olindor is an adventure designed for 7th-level rogue, or other character of similar abilities. The obstacles in the
adventure are set up to encourage the use of stealth and trickery, and many rely on classic rogue skills. The adventure
takes place in the city of Cairdus, the details of which have been intentionally left imprecise, so that it can be easily slipped
          into an existing campaign, or better yet the adventure can be altered to take place in any existing city.

Starvation looms for the people of the Wolf tribe! The elk have all but disappeared and the risky move of the tribe
near the Bear clan territory has proved fruitless. An emergency council of the elders has declared that a single
hearty warrior must make the dangerous journey deeper into Bear territory to find a source of food. The council has
chosen you for this mission of great importance. It is your task to find out where the elk have gone and bring back
      food for the winter or at least enact Wolf people retribution against the source of the oncoming famine!

Hubrimort is a small, respectable town whose only claim to fame is a local governmental position bestowed by five of the
king’s chosen officials, known as the Cavaliers. The position is given to the head of one of four noble families once each
decade. While competition for the mysterious position is always fierce, this year there are rumors of underhanded deals with
criminals, rigged tournaments, and a nasty case of blackmail.Which of the ancient families deserves ten years of power and
                     privilege? Only the Sixth Cavalier can help the five officials make the right choice!

The Sixth Cavalier is a single-session adventure designed for a 10th level bard, although a rogue or other skill-focused utility
                                            character can also enjoy the scenario.

   DESCRIPTION
   This suit of +3 Scale Mail is created from the multicolored hide
   of some snakelike monster, so light and supple that it feels no
   heavier than a thick cotton shirt. Speed while wearing the
   Armor of the Serpent is 30 feet for Medium creatures or 20
   feet for Small. The armor has an arcane spell failure chance
   of 10%, a maximum Dexterity bonus of +5, and no armor
   check penalty. It is considered light armor and weighs 10
   pounds. Anyone wearing the Armor of the Serpent gains a
   +4 circumstance bonus on saves against poison and a +5
   competence bonus to Climb, Escape Artist and Stealth checks.
   On command, the wearer may order the armor to resemble a
   normal traveling outfit, a fine performance ensemble, or any
   other normal suit of clothing. No matter what its appearance,
   a long flowing tail of scaled hide hangs back behind the
   wearer as a cloak or cape as well -- no magical cloak or cape
   may be used while this armor is worn.

  DC 15: More detailed information about the dueling judge,
     Sage Harkin. Harkin is apparently not much of a wizard,
     but as the oldest and most respected learned man in
     town, he was the first one approached for the position. A
     vain man, Harkin hates to be seen as anything less than
     regal. It is thus possible that if his concentration were
     disrupted somehow, he would be too proud to cast detect
     magic again and admit that he had lost the spell.
  DC 20: Individual townsfolk provide bits and pieces of
     information that provide useful tidbits about the town
     square. One vendor who usually has a booth where the
     square is now is concerned that the stakes he left in the
     ground could trip an unwary combatant, while another
     vendor complains about the glare from the temple dome
     when standing in a specific spot.
  DC 25: A playful group of children are planning to watch the
     duel from above, and will share their information with
     the Sixth in his guise as a friendly minstrel. From the
     rooftop of the gem shop (which can be reached with a
     Climb check, DC 15), the children can get within twenty
     feet of the dueling square without being seen by their
     parents. Anyone watching while crouched on the rooftop
     can get extremely close to either the combatants or the
     dueling judge with enough cover to allow a Stealth check.

VALE OF THE SEPULCHER (LEVEL 9-11 CLERIC)
  Adventure Synopsis
  Something is amiss in the remote mountain town of Zuria.
  The head priest has not filed a report in months, and traders
  following the winding road into the high-altitude valley do not
  find their way back home. The Church of Palnor, benefactor
  and watchers of the Tomb of Kings, are greatly concerned.
  They have sent the PC to investigate the matter, giving him a
  wide latitude within the parameters of faith to discover what
  has happened and to contain problems.


  Integrating the Adventure
  This adventure is designed for 1 Game Master and 1 player,
  cleric level 9-11. The PC may be a cleric from the Church of
  Palnor, a cleric of a sympathetic cause or church, or a hired
  professional cleric that “solves problems.” There is a sample
  PC provided, and it is highly recommended that the PC be
  a cleric that chooses to channel positive energy rather than
  channel negative energy. While a background is provided,
  this adventure can take place in any world, so long as the city
  is in a remote area in the mountains. Vale of the Sepulcher
  is episode-based, where places, events, and creatures are
  presented with options for PC interaction, depending on the
  choices the PC makes.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Command Undead (Su): Skeletons that are commanded by a bone sovereign are
    drawn towards the creature and permanently merged into its form when
    they make contact. Other types of undead can’t be merged with it, but a
    bone sovereign usually keeps commanded wraiths, shadows, ghouls,
    and other lesser undead nearby for as long as possible. Because of the
    desecration aura created by its presence, such beings frequently follow a
    bone sovereign even after its domination has lapsed. In some cases, the
    gruesome entourage that accompanies a bone sovereign can be more
    dangerous than the bone sovereign itself.
Desecrate (Su): The bone sovereign benefits from all of the spell’s powers
    (included in the statistics block), but undead allies do not gain desecrate’s
    attack and damage bonuses.
Skeleton Merge (Su): When a bone sovereign comes into contact with an
    animated skeleton under its control, it can merge the other monster into its
    form as a free action, adding the normal skeleton’s Hit Dice to its own. For
    example, a Large 6 HD bone sovereign that merges with a troll skeleton (6
    HD) becomes a Huge 12 HD bone sovereign. The skeleton ceases to exist as
    a separate entity and becomes part of the bone sovereign. 5-8 HD (Large);
    9-12 HD ( Huge); 13-16 HD (Gargantuan); 17+ HD (Colossal)
Skeleton Spawn (Su): As a standard action, a bone sovereign can create any
    number of skeletal monsters from its body. Skeletons spawned by the
    bone sovereign are under its complete mental control. The Hit Dice of
    the spawned creatures are deducted from the bone sovereign’s Hit
    Dice, and return to the sovereign when it again merges with the spawn.
    If a skeleton spawn is destroyed, it cannot be merged back into the
    bone sovereign; its Hit Dice are lost. Spawned skeletons are treated
    in all ways like standard skeletons, and can act as the remains of any
    creature the sovereign desires. A bone sovereign can lose no
    more than half its Hit Dice in one round, and cannot
    reduce its Hit Dice to fewer than 4 through this process.
          Spawned skeletons can be of any variety of types.
    For example, a bone sovereign with 24 Hit Dice could
    create any combination of skeletons which adds up to
    12 Hit Dice or fewer. There is no limit to the number of
    spawned skeletons a bone sovereign can control at once.

there are many ways to foil this attempt, complete success
means dealing with doorway into the abyss or even the ebon

      The main chamber of this building is a long open space,
      interrupted only by wooden support beams. At the far end,
      a raised platform makes a simple stage. Around the edges
      of the room are two floors of seating boxes complete with
      chairs and small tables.

  The meetinghouse is the largest public gathering space
  in Kendleton, and it is owned and maintained by the city
  government. Its original purpose was to hold town meetings
  so the city council could hear from the citizens. It has since
  become the choice location for most major events, including
  the auction of the Shroud of Olindor.
       Beside the main hall, the rest of the meeting hall is used
  for storage, except for a small office. The office is not regularly
  staffed unless there is an event going on, but until day 3,
  the false shroud is stored within the office safe (2 in. thick;

THE SHROUD OF OLINDOR (LEVEL 7-9 ROGUE)
  THE SHROUD OF OLINDOR
  The Shroud of Olindor is one of several famed treasures that
  belonged to the ancient elven city of Olindor. During the life
  of the city, the Shroud was used by a rogue who was renowned
  for his ability to vanish without a trace.
  The Shroud appears to be a frayed and tattered cloth, blacker
  than the depth on any cavern. A character can tie the cloth
  around her neck and wear it much like a cloak.
        The Shroud of Olindor grants a +15 competence bonus
  to Stealth, and it allows the wielder to hide even while
  being observed. As long as she is within 10 feet of some
  sort of shadow, the wearer hides herself from view in the
  open without anything to actually hide behind. She cannot,
  however, hide in her own shadow.
        Further, 1/day the character can turn invisible as the
  greater invisibility spell.
        The Shroud is also very good at hiding itself. While it
  radiates a magic aura when not worn, once donned it no
  longer detects as magical. Further, the wielder may command
  the shroud to physically alter itself into nearly any object that
  would take up the cloak slot. In extreme circumstances, the
  Shroud may transform into a tattoo on the wearer’s back, but
  in this form it provides no magical abilities.

The Golden Bough is the most expensive inn in the town and is

business woman, who has a minor knack for illusions.
     The image of the sky on the ceiling is actually a permanent
illusion that Leandra commissioned when the inn was first
built (it is beyond her ability to create). Most of the time it
automatically matches the sky outside, but Leandra can also
change it to suit her will, which she typically does for concerts
and other special occasions.

lodging (2 gp), and the bar has all but the rarest drinks.

                              by Doug Douglason
                 An adventure for one barbarian levels 7-9




The Pleasure Prison of the B’thuvian Demon Whore: the adventure that is, quite frankly, too strong for the mere hobbyist gamer!
A desert caravan ambushed! An incognito Queen elfnapped and taken to some sandy hideaway! A hero of epic proportions!
Within these covers is the greatest adventure ever told. Will the dangerous renegade B’thuvian Demon Whore Alayshia have
her way with our hero or will he have her to his way? Which way will the having be? Only you, playing the role of Krunk
                                       barbarian of the frozen wastes, will ever know…

This adventure is designed for Krunk, barbarian of the frozen wastes, a 7th-Level barbarian, but if you play it with anyone other
                         than Krunk, you’d best be a few levels higher. Krunk is a god among men.

THE PLEASURE PRISON OF THE B’THUVIAN DEMON WHORE
                                                                                  Introduction
  Welcome Elite Gamemasters! You hold in your hands the best single module you will ever own. Packed with adventure,
  intrigue and women of questionable morals, 1 on 1 Adventures #6.66: The Pleasure Prison of the B’thuvian Demon Whore
  delivers on all expectations. Expect the unexpected, and prepare to be amazed by the masterwork before you! When we
  approached Mr. Douglason about releasing his work into the mainstream, he was at first hesitant, knowing his work to be too
  strong for the hobbyist gamer. And in this respect he showed an understanding of the business-side of the creative endeavor
  called role-playing games; for many FLGS throughout the nation refuse to carry 1 on 1 Adventures #6.66: The Pleasure Prison
  of the B’thuvian Demon Whore because it is too strong for their store. That, my gentle readers, is their own decision, but I feel
  they are missing a unique opportunity to be part of something truly creative. So if you hold this work in your hands through a
  purchase from your FLGS, know that your store recognizes brilliance and understands the desires of its gamers: it is a truly an
  Elite Gaming Store!
       I’d like to thank YNG Turk Films and Ryan Wood for Fear of Girls, the wonderful short documentary that introduced me,
  and the gaming world, to Doug Douglason.

  Think, for a moment, about the power of the mind—the power of the pen. The power of the pen put to paper with some ink
  and a force of personality. Think in that moment, the highest achievement possible: a new world! What you hold in your hands
  is but a slice, a smidgen, a wafer-thin portion of a complex thematic tapestry created over decades of unceasing labor. And it is
  this labor that you will see in every sentence of The Pleasure Prison—a labor of creative energy, a labor of mental acuity, a labor
  of love.
       And remember, Elite Game Masters don’t just create adventures, they become them! You must weave this adventure into
  your existing campaign, reinforcing your multi-layered tapestry of themes and subject matter that is, quite frankly, simply too
  strong for the “hobbyist gamer.”

                                                   Elite Game Master Tips and Tricks!
  Not everyone is an Elite Game Master—far from it! Most GMs are, at best, capable story tellers, hardworking men crafting
  their tales with what skills they’ve haphazardly acquired. But Elite Game Masters are a breed apart: GMs who’ve studied and
  practiced their skills by daily stretching their boundaries in both role-playing and roll-playing. For those of you reading this who
  fear you might be just an average GM, I present a few tips and tricks that may help you push yourself into the realm of mastery,
  into the realm of real power!

  Role-Play. This may be an obvious thing to many of you, but I never cease to be amazed at the lack of role-playing I see in
      so many games. Take on the persona of the person or creature your PCs are encountering and make it your own. As Sir
      Lawrence Olivier once told Dustin Hoffman during the filming of Marathon Man, “I’m an actor.” And you should take
      such good advice in hand and move your encounters into the realm of acting based upon the written script before you.
      Don’t be afraid to ad lib occasionally, but remember, the writer is as much an artist as you and solemnly consider his
      efforts and work before making any substantial changes.
  The 5 Senses. We’re sensual creatures, full of senses and sensations. Use this to your advantage! If your player enters a bright
      cave after a long run underground, shine a flashlight in his eyes as you read the room’s description. If your player’s PC
      is at an elven ball, throw on some Enya or Lorenna McKennit and bounce the night away in gay ministrations. After
      discovering a new treasure map, place your handmade map in front of them as they debate if it’s real or merely a clever
      ruse. During their discussions have your player’s taste the delicious pot roast served in the inn (don’t forget the rosemary)
      and after a long fight with a pair of ogre blackguards, have your players dig through your unwashed laundry for the key
      they need to open the next chest. Remember the fives sense and your role-playing will move to the next level.
  The Adventure is the Process. Lao Tzu once said, “A good traveler has no fixed plans and is not intent on arriving.” This is
      perfect advice for the Elite Game Master! Lao Tzu could have easily said to a new game master, “An Elite Game Master
      has no fixed plans and is not intent upon railroading his PCs into following every plot and theme nook-and-cranny
      especially when the players would rather head off east for a bit until this whole thing settles down.” Remember, an
      adventure is a guideline, a single plot, a background upon which the stars of the show prance and disembowel.
  The Voice as Medium. The best weapon in any Elite Game Master’s arsenal is his voice. You should learn to rumble like
      a rock giant, twitter like a grig, babble like a gibbering mouther, and lustfully seduce like the most brazen strumpet.
      Immersive game play begins when you open your mouth, so be certain what comes out is guaranteed to evoke an
      emotional response from your players. They want to be taken on a fantasy trip into realms of heroic and villainous deeds
      so make sure your voice is ready for the journey! I recommend a steady stream of Mountain Dew to keep the palate alert
      and ready for duty.

THE PLEASURE PRISON OF THE B’THUVIAN DEMON WHORE
                                             As you turn your horse to the large caravanserais
                                        located near the far corner of the courtyard, you’re
                                        approached by one of the Uz-Kala. He hails you and asks
                                        your business.

                                    The Uz-Kala representative is named Eslamshar. He’s dressed
                                    in a long white robe, and a scimitar is strapped to his waist.
                                    His eyes are dark under his blood red turban. Eslamshar is
                                    willing to discuss Uz-Kala business and will inform Krunk
                                    that they haven’t raided any caravans in several weeks and
                                    that there are no elf females in their current slave stock for a
                                    reasonable price.
                                         Eslamshar will answer all Krunk’s reasonable questions,
                                    but he won’t spend more than a half hour in discussion as he
                                    has others to speak with as well. He’ll point Krunk towards
                                    the caravanserais boarding house for the night’s lodging and
                                    suggest he travel east along the trade route in the morning to
                                    find what he’s looking for, if it’s even happened at all.


                                    The Caravan Ambush
                                    Read the following as Krunk approches the ambush scene:

                                        Before you lies the carnage of battle: bodies face down in
                                        blood-stained sands and the all too familiar acrid scent
                                        of fear and voided bowels. The bodies of 10 camels, 5
                                        handlers, and 5 guards scatter the area, like a poorly
                                        assembled children’s puzzle made by some mad toymaker.
                                        Odd that the camels were killed, but the footprints of the
                                        assailants explain the action: kobolds!

                                    A lot of information can be gleaned from the battle depending
                                    on the success of Krunk’s Suvival attempt from studying the
                                    tracks. Given the nature of the scene, allow Krunk to make a
                                    new Survival check for every 10 minutes he spends assessing
                                    what happened. Up to 3 checks can be made in this process.
                                    After this period, nothing new can be learned from the bloody
                                    sands. Following the group of traveling kobolds through the
                                    sands only requires a successful DC 0 check. This check will be
                                    modified based upon terrain, so note any changes in this check
                                    under each individual encounter area. The DC 0 check will
                                    eventually lead Krunk to the mostly abandoned kobold lair.

                                    SURVIVAL DCS AT THE CARAVAN AMBUSH
                                    DC 0: The caravan was ambushed by kobolds. It looks like to
                                       be at least 20.
                                    DC 5: The caravan was ambushed by 21 kobolds who
                                       attacked from the south and fled south-southwest.
                                    DC 10: Mixed among the kobold tracks heading south are
                                       several humanoid tracks. They look to be either human
                                       or elf.
                                    DC 15: There are both human and elf tracks heading south
                                       among the kobolds. Given the strange lines near the
                                       tracks they appear to have had their ankles loosely tied
                                       together.
                                    DC 20: There were three humans taken and one elf. The elf’s
                                       ankles were not tied like the humans. The footprints are
                                       rather small, suggesting they were all female.
                                    DC 25: The small caravan moved slowly westward, trudging
                                       under the harsh sun. Suddenly they were surprised by
                                       yipping kobolds swarming over the tops of the nearby
                                       southern dune. The camels and handlers went down
                                       quickly as they were clumped together while the guards,

     The ritual of creating/summoning a demon whore first
requires access to a rarely known plane called the Plane of
Naughty. It’s not quite evil, but it’s not quite good. And
forget about it being neutral—it has an agenda. The Plane of
Naughty is itself sentient, and it wants to get a bit bigger than
it currently is and is using the demon whores to further its
goals. In this way, a permanent portal to the Plane of Naughty
has been established in the pleasure prison and a small portion
of the plane set aside as residence for Alayshia, unwitting
champion to the Plane’s cause.

to successfully follow the requirements of the summoning and
binding rituals as all her attempts up to this point have failed,
resulting in the creatures she terms “the Corrupted.” Needless
to say, she’s not happy with this, and she’s been taking out her
anger and peevishness on everything around her, increasing
the typical conflict level in her kobold tribe.

and use three very powerful magic items as focuses for her
next summons attempt.

B’THUVIAN BACKGROUND
B’thuvia: the most decadent of the decadent southern
kingdoms—the heart of the Malibat coast, the serpent kingdom
that slithers along the northern edge of the dark continent. Its
cities like jewels, its people swarthy-skinned and swarthy-
hearted in their joys, lusts, and cruelties. Far B’thuvia: a flame
to the mercenary, the scoundrel, the rogue, the slaver. It is here,
millennia ago, that the first demon whores were summoned.
      Even then, decadence was great in B’thuvia. Boredoms
deferred by pleasures of the flesh, lotus-dreams, power, and
gold would always arise again in the great merchant families.
Hundreds of years of wealth and debauchery eventually gave
way to demonic studies and pursuits of the darkest kind,
and the B’thuvians quickly became well-known as the best
scholars concerning demonic and infernal matters in the 371⁄2
kingdoms. It was during this initial stygian phase that, deep
beneath the stepped pyramids of Urlaktloc, the first demon
whores were summoned and forced to submit to the dark
lusts of those who summoned them. It was only a matter of
a few years before the B’thuvians mixed their two greatest
interests—debauchery and money— and began selling demon
whores (and their controlling rings) on the open market.
Slowly, they made their way across the 371⁄2 kingdoms and
even to the mighty Ghantes River, where the radical clerics
of Isfala outlawed their trade and insured that they would
infiltrate their kingdom like nothing before as a single demon
whore became worth its weight in gold overnight.
      As one would expect given their names, B’thuvian demon
whores are demons trained in the arts of pleasure. Where

    Dominion over many lands was his for years numbering
    eight and eighty.
          The skies turned black and the heavens wept blood
    at the innocence the world had lost. Lord Xyrix scoffed
    at the many attempts to unseat his majesty, and gathered
    together a host of dark minions to make war upon the lands
    of men. The flames of war consumed his enemies and the
    gold of a thousand great halls were his.
          It was then that Xyrix gathered his host altogether in
    the place of Zaaz, and there raised a mighty temple in his
    name, glistening with the living soul stones of his enemies.
    Rivers flowed like blood from his ritual chambers. From
    that fell throne did Xyrix turn his greedy eyes towards the
    seas and the lands beyond.
          Then did the cries of the people reach heaven. In their
    darkest hour did Zan-rei the Ascendant Dragon come
    down and make war against Xyrix. His celestial form was
    of the purest, shining gold and struck terrible fear into the
    hearts of the wicked. The armies of the Netherworld Prince
    were tossed aside by his furor as though nothing. Zan-rei
    challenged Xyrix himself and their struggle laid waste to
    the lush land of Zaaz. Zan-rei defeated the mighty Xyrix,
    but at great cost as much of his life essence was consumed.
    And even then, the dread sovereign was not destroyed, but
    contained within a prison of the Dragon’s devising.
          Zan-rei’s soul fire burned low, and lo, he lay upon the
    battlefield slowly fading from this world. And in his final
    hours, did the Ascendant Dragon call to the stars for aid
    and comfort. And his plea was heard from on high.
          Descending from heaven in forms of glory were the
    Dragon’s siblings, Celestial Crane and Perfect Tiger.
    And they lent their brother succor as his life waned. They

  At this point, the encounter effectively resets. The PC is healed to maximum hit
  points and any negative combat conditions (i.e. shaken or ability score damage,
  etc.) is healed. Any daily use or point based items or abilities however, remain
  unchanged. Additionally, the PC immediately gains the benefits of the following

  minded in combat and will fight to the death. If the GM
  wishes to have Xyrix as a recurring villain, then it’s possible

  rat has gotten quite big. He is a docile and faithful pet to Krox,
  who Squeaker has imprinted as a maternal figure, but his
  demeanor quickly sours around others. As he is well fed, he
  doesn’t attack creatures out of hunger, but when he attacks, it
  is out of ferocious spite. Krox has been trying to train Squeaker,
  but to little avail. During the day, Squeaker has a 50% chance of
  accompanying Krox in the mines (area 25) on a leash or staying
  in Krox’s quarters. In the evenings, Krox and pet spend their
  evenings with dinner and a small fire in a brazier.
       Krox holds the key to the prison (area 24), which he locks
  up in the evening after he brings their evening meal, which
  remains locked until the morning.

  Zarial became the new warden of Granite’s End after a
  particularly violent uprising. He realized that the key to              1                                        2
  quashing the impulse to rebel was to keep the prisoners busy
  fighting amongst each other. Thus he chose three prisoners                                                                 5

  special privileges provided that they work to maintain order                       5

  prisoners soon became leaders of the three powerful factions                              6

  began battling against each other to control territory and other
  resources within the prison. Over the years, new leaders have

       Due in large part to Zarial’s manipulations, none of these
  factions ever gains a permanent upper hand against any other.
  As soon as one begins to gain power, the other two form a
  temporary alliance to bring down the more powerful leader.             D7. Grissarrk’s Quarters: Door locked (Disable Device DC

          With a light chain, you get a +2 bonus on opposed attack rolls made to disarm an enemy (including the roll to
      avoid being disarmed if such an attempt fails). You can also use this weapon to make trip attacks. If you are tripped
      during your own trip attempt, you can drop the flail to avoid being tripped.
      Handbow: A handbow is small bow that sacrifices power and range for concealability.
          You need at least two hands to use a bow, regardless of its size. You can use a handbow while mounted. If you
      have a penalty for low Strength, apply it to damage rolls when you use a shortbow.
          You received a +2 bonus to Sleight of Hand checks to conceal a handbow that is unstrung as well as handbow
      arrows. Stringing a handbow is a move action.

                                                       Familiar Faces
   If you play this adventure as a sequel to The Star of Olindor and/or The Shroud of Olindor, the player character may
   encounter some familiar faces, as the villains of those adventures may have been sent to Granite’s End.
        Any of the foes may return to make the PCs life difficult. The more martial enemies may attack the PC directly, but
   that is not the only possibility. An old foe may oppose the character when she attempts to join a faction, or may explain
   that the PC is not the criminal she pretends. These complications are completely optional, and omitting some or all of
   them bears no effect on the adventure’s outcome.
        Baron Velstaf and Azalor join the Feral Kin. While Velstaf has little to contribute deprived of his fortune, Azalor
   retains his extraordinary combat skills and hopes to erode Grissarrk’s support to gain control of the faction. Elskar
   meanwhile joins Hammer and Bow, but deprived of her magic, her threat level is greatly reduced.
        Lord Dragle joins the Shadow Strikers, and attempts to assist by providing clever schemes. Quarillos Starwhisper, as
   well as Gurt and Sable, joins the Hammer and Bow. Quarillos is setting up plans to gain control of the faction when the
   current leaders are found with their slit throats in the night.
